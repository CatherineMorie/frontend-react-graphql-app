## General Info
This project is a front-end Pokemon application that hits a GraphQL server, returning Pokemon data.
Before starting project, set up dev server and scripts to host app on modern browsers (Serve, react-scripts).

Course: Scrimba - Build an app with React and GraphQL (https://scrimba.com/course/greactgraphql)

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* React
* GraphQL
* Apollo
* CSS
* Pokemon open API (https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/)

## Workflow Outline
* Initial setup (file/folder creation, dependencies, scripts, browserslist)
* Boilerplate code
* Connect to GraphQL server
* Create components
* Style application

## Setup
```
Clone repo to local machine
$ git clone https://github.com/CatherineMorie/frontend-react-graphql-app.git

Change directory to `frontend-react-graphql-app`
$ cd frontend-react-graphql-app

Install and run completed app from within this directory
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Should receive a message stating "Serving!" with two options to connect. Visit either in the browser.

There is also a dev script for running in a browser to view ongoing changes. If used and code changed,
need to follow up with `npm build` to update the build folder used in prod (via `npm start`).

## Reason for Creating
This application was built/course taken as a precursor to using React, GraphQL, Apollo and CSS in an upcoming
professional (fullstack) project.
